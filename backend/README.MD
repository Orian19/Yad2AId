Scrapy spiders usage:
1. run apartments_spider.py with 'scrapy crawl apartments' from the terminal
2. run description_spider.py with 'scrapy crawl descriptions' from the terminal
* might need to run with different user agents or different browsers (firefox is not bad) to avoid cpatcha and bot detection
